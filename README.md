- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike McGrath
- 👀 I have been a professional game developer since 1996, working on some fairly well-known projects, like Red Baron 2/3D, the Gen7 Godzilla melee games, Prince of Persia onthe PSP, SOCOM PSP, MAG, SOCOM 4, Unit 13, Project Spark, and perhaps most notably, Minecraft.  The first game I contributed to, as a hobby, was an internet classic called "Netrek", which is often regarded as the first MOBA, and banned on several college campuses in the 80s and 90s. :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on tools and engine code for a game called Apex: Legends.  Lots of stuff to learn here!
- 💞️ As Mojang/Minecraft's (initial and now former) AR/VR tech lead, I still enjoy the AR/VR space a great deal, and have a lot of knowledge about it.  I love those types of projects!
- 📫 Nope.  As an industry professional I can't participate in anything that would be considered competitive with my employer.  You can figure out how to reach me, if you have something outside of that space to talk about.
